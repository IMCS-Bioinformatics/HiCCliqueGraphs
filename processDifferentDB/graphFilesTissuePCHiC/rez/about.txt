This directory will contain generated files.
files for chrX are given as an example.
The .json files contain all the data in format that our scripts are processing.
The .csv file contains info about all segments (nodes) of the chromsome in different tissue types. 
isInClique: true if this node is a part of at least one C3 in the current tissue type graph.
Columns about FANTOM5 array of genome-wide transcription profiles (Forrest et al. (2014))
fantomDistance: distance in base pairs to the closest FANTOM5 segment.
fantomExpression: the expression value of the closest FANTOM5.
fantomCount: numebr of FANTOM5 that were the closest to the given segment. If the value is greater than one and fantomDistance=0, then the current segment overlaps with more than one FANTOM5 segment, and the fantomExpression value is the max expression of all fantom5 segments.
GTExExpression, GTExDistance, GTExCount - same as for FANTOM5, but using Roadmap Epigenomics per Kundaje et al. (2015).
RNAPolCount: 0 if there is no RNA Polymerase in the current segment. RNA polymerase II sites in our cliques are obtained using TF ChIP-seq data from ENCODE (see Luo et al. (2020))
