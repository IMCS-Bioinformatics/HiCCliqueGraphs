## Analysis of randomized graphs
Here are scripts that can be used to analyze C3 and S(k) counts in randomized graphs.

Use comparison.py to run the analysis and generate a csv file with C3, S(k) and other data comparing 2 graphs - original and randomized.
Change the hard-coded paths to graph files at the bottom of the file and run the analysis.
