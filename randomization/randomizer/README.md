## Randomization
In this directory randomized graphs can be created

randomize_shake.py script contains hard-coded path to an original graph that should be randomized (The path is at the bottom of the file).
Change it to run this randomization on another dataset.

It contains relative paths to the datasets, so the script should be executed from the root directory of the project.
