# Transforming base data to a universal format
This directory has files to transform all of our datasets from their original format to one universal format for easier further processing.
Scripts contains hard-coded paths to original data that should be converted to universal format (the path is at the top of the file stored in templ variable). Change it to match the location of original data.
