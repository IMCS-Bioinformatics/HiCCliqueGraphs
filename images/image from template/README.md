# Image from template
This directory contains semi-automated generation of images. 

[drawFromTemplate.ipynb](./drawFromTemplate.ipynb) notebook allows to create different images from templates. It creates images and also creates json files. These json files can be visualized, using the [visualizator.html](./vizualizator.html), where any generated json file should be selected and an interactive image will be seen in browser.

Some json files are included here as an example to use. 
X axis has loci of the cromosome, and y axis corresponds to a count of some object in particular loci.
