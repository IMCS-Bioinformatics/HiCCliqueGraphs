# Images from our paper
This directory has scripts for generating images to compare some aspects of datasets.

Images comparing link lengths of different objects can be generated using [analyzeLinkLengths notebook](./analyzeLinkLengths.ipynb).

Images to compare all 3 dataset link loci can be generated using [all3DSinOne notebook](./all3DSinOne.ipynb).

[Image from template](./image%20from%20template/) directory contains scipts and an interactive visualization that enables to visualize different objects of datasets in different loci, e.g., C3 count in different chromosome loci.
